## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on generalized linear models. 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A06_GLMs.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.


## Set up your session 
1. Set up your session. Check your working directory. Load the tidyverse, agricolae and other needed packages. Import the *raw* NTL-LTER raw data file for chemistry/physics (`NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv`). Set date columns to date objects.

2. Build a ggplot theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r setup}
#1
getwd()
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("agricolae")
library(agricolae)
#install.packages(lubridate)
library(lubridate)
#install.packages(cowpot)
library(cowplot)
options(scipen = 4)

NTL_LTER_ChemistryPhysics <-
  read.csv("./Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

NTL_LTER_ChemistryPhysics$sampledate <-
  as.Date(NTL_LTER_ChemistryPhysics$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

#2
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top",
        legend.title = element_text(size=10),
        legend.text = element_text(size=7))
theme_set(mytheme)

```

## Simple regression
Our first research question is: Does mean lake temperature recorded during July change with depth across all lakes?

3. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this question:
> Answer:
H0: slope(beta)=0 There is no relationship between mean lake temperature recorded during July and depth across all lakes.
Ha: slope(beta)!=0 There is relationship between mean lake temperature recorded during July and depth across all lakes.

$$ y = \alpha + \beta*x + \epsilon $$
$$ meanLakeTemperatureinJuly = \alpha + \beta*depth + \epsilon $$

4.  Wrangle your NTL-LTER dataset with a pipe function so that the records meet the following criteria: 
 * Only dates in July. 
 * Only the columns: `lakename`, `year4`, `daynum`, `depth`, `temperature_C`
 * Only complete cases (i.e., remove NAs)

5. Visualize the relationship among the two continuous variables with a scatter plot of temperature by depth. Add a smoothed line showing the linear model, and limit temperature values from 0 to 35 째C. Make this plot look pretty and easy to read.

```{r scatterplot}
#4
NTL_LTER_Processed <-
  NTL_LTER_ChemistryPhysics %>%
  filter(month(sampledate) == 7) %>%
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, depth, temperature_C) %>%
  drop_na(depth) %>%
  drop_na(temperature_C)

#5
plot5 <- 
  ggplot(NTL_LTER_Processed, aes(x = depth, y = temperature_C, color = lakename)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 20) +
  ylim(0, 35) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "black")
print(plot5)

```


6. Interpret the figure. What does it suggest with regards to the response of temperature to depth? Do the distribution of points suggest about anything about the linearity of this trend?

> Answer: It suggests that there is a negative relationship between mean lake temperature recorded in July and depth across all lakes. As depth increases, temperature decreases. I would consider it a relatively weak correlation as a number of points occurring in a downward pattern but not as linear and appeared as a much scatter field of points.


7. Perform a linear regression to test the relationship and display the results

```{r linear.regression}
#7
temperature.regression <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_Processed, temperature_C ~ depth)
summary(temperature.regression)

cor.test(NTL_LTER_Processed$temperature_C, NTL_LTER_Processed$depth)

```


8. Interpret your model results in words. Include how much of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth, the degrees of freedom on which this finding is based, and the statistical significance of the result. Also mention how much temperature is predicted to change for every 1m change in depth. 

> Answer: The residual of this model is from -9.5173 (min) to 13.5834 (max). The slope is -1.94621 with 0.06792 standard error, which indicates a negative relationship between temperature and depth. As depth increases by 1 meter, temperature decreases by 1.94621째C. The intercept is 21.95597 with 0.01174 standard error which means that when depth is 0, temperature is estimated to be at 21.95597째C. The p-value is less than 0.05 (which is our confidence level). Thus, the coefficient is statistically different than 0. So the result is statistically significant. It's worth to estimate temperature based on depth or there is a relationship. The degrees of freedom is 9726. The residual standard error is 3.825.R-squared value tells us that depth explains about 73.87% of the variability in temperature. The correlation is -0.8595 so there is a strong correlation between temperature and depth.

## Multiple regression
Let's tackle a similar question from a different approach. Here, we want to explore what might the best set of predictors for lake temperature in July across the monitoring period at the North Temperate Lakes LTER. 


9. Run an AIC to determine what set of explanatory variables (year4, daynum, depth) is best suited to predict temperature.

10. Run a multiple regression on the recommended set of variables. 

```{r temperature.model}
#9
TPAIC <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_Processed, temperature_C ~ year4 + daynum + depth)
step(TPAIC)

#10
TPmodel <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_Processed, temperature_C ~ year4 + daynum + depth)
summary(TPmodel)

```

11. What is the final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression? How much of the observed variance does this model explain? Is this an improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable?

> Answer: 
The final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests are year4, daynum, and depth. R-squared value tells us that this model explains about 74.12% of the variability in temperature. It is slightly more than the previous model using only depth thus it iss an improvement using these three explanatory variables.

## Analysis of Variance

12. Now we want to see whether the different lakes have, on average, different temperatures in the month of July. Run an ANOVA test to complete this analysis. (No need to test assumptions of normality or similar variances.) Create two sets of models: one expressed as an ANOVA models and another expressed as a linear model (as done in our lessons).

```{r anova.model}
#12
Temperature.anova <- aov(data = NTL_LTER_Processed, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(Temperature.anova)

Temperature.anova2 <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_Processed, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(Temperature.anova2)

```

13. Is there a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes? Report your findings. 

> Answer: Yes, there is a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes. From the anova model, we have the p-value <2e-16 which is less than 0.05. So we reject the null hypothesis (means are equal). From the linear model, we got similar results that the p-values are all smaller than 0.05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis. We got for example, temperature of Crampton lake is estimated at 17.6664-2.3145 and temperature of east long lake is at 17.6664-7.3987째C.



14. Create a graph that depicts temperature by depth, with a separate color for each lake. Add a geom_smooth (method = "lm", se = FALSE) for each lake. Make your points 50 % transparent. Adjust your y axis limits to go from 0 to 35 degrees. Clean up your graph to make it pretty. 

```{r scatterplot.2}
#14.
plot14 <- 
  ggplot(NTL_LTER_Processed, aes(x = depth, y = temperature_C, color = lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(0, 20) +
  ylim(0, 35) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
print(plot14)

```

15. Use the Tukey's HSD test to determine which lakes have different means.

```{r tukey.test}
#15
TukeyHSD(Temperature.anova)
Temperature.groups <- HSD.test(Temperature.anova, "lakename", group = TRUE)
Temperature.groups
```

16.From the findings above, which lakes have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake? Does any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes?

>Answer: Ward Lake and Paul Lake have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake, because they are all in c groups. There is not any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes because all groups a-e have at least two lakes.

 

17. If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake. What's another test we might explore to see whether they have distinct mean temperatures? 

>Answer: We might use the two-sample T-test to examine whether the mean temperature for Peter Lake equals to the mean temperature for Paul lake or not.



18. Wrangle the July data to include only records for Crampton Lake and Ward Lake. Run the two-sample T-test on these data to determine whether their July temperature are same or different. What does the test say? Are the mean temperatures for the lakes equal? Does that match you answer for part 16?

```{r t.test}
NTL_LTER_Ttest <- 
  NTL_LTER_Processed %>%
  filter(lakename == "Crampton Lake" | lakename == "Ward Lake")

twosample18 <- t.test(NTL_LTER_Ttest$temperature_C ~ NTL_LTER_Ttest$lakename)
twosample18

```

>Answer: P-value = 0.2649 > 0.05 so we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, the difference in means between Crampton Lake and Ward Lake is equal to 0. The mean temperatures for the two lakes are equal. From question 16, they both have b in groups which indicates that their means are statistically equal. Therefore, the t-test answer matches my answer for part 16.
